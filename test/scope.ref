# 1 "scope.cppo"
(* This example shows that the definition of FOO that is nested inside
   the (multi-line) definition of BAR affects only the body of the
   definition of BAR. It does not affect the text that follows a call
   to BAR. So, a multi-line macro definition acts as a scope delimiter. *)

# 11 "scope.cppo"
 "definition of FOO at the top level"  
# 11 "scope.cppo"
    (* expands to "definition of FOO at the top level" *)

   "definition of FOO inside BAR"  (* expands to "definition of FOO inside BAR" *)
 
# 13 "scope.cppo"
 "definition of FOO at the top level"  
# 13 "scope.cppo"
    (* expands to "definition of FOO at the top level" *)

(* If one wishes to delimit a scope, without actually defining a macro,
   one can use #scope ... #endscope. *)


  
# 20 "scope.cppo"
   "first definition of HELLO"  
# 20 "scope.cppo"

# 24 "scope.cppo"
   "second definition of HELLO"  
# 24 "scope.cppo"
        (* expands to "second definition of HELLO" *)
HELLO (* this does not expand *)

(* The effect of #scope ... #endscope can be simulated by writing
   #def DUMMY ... #enddef DUMMY #undef DUMMY
   but this is a bit unnatural. *)

   "definition of HELLO inside the scope"  (* expands to "definition of HELLO inside the scope" *)
